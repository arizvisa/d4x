************** WebDownloader's plans ******************
last modified at [Sat Aug  5 00:12:25 2000]

Version 1.20 will not be released without documentation in English.
There is already text documentation in Russian (it's my native language)
but it hard to translate it to English.

'Hot list' should be implemented till releasing 1.20 but
there is a chance that it will be implemented after ftp search.

Ftp search abilities will appear in version 1.21 (I hope :)
First realisation of 'ftp search' should include automatic search mirrors of
a file and automatic sort alternative URLs by connection/reconnection
speed.

I hope to add SOCKS in 1.25-1.30

Public relation shown that other planed features had a less value.
You can see all my plans in TODO file.
