************** WebDownloader's plans ******************

Version 1.21 will contain:

    First realisation of 'ftp search' which will include automatic searching
for mirrors of a file and automatic sorting of alternative URLs by
connection/reconnection speed.
    Resuming downloading for splitted downloads.
    Interface improvings (new column in queue, new options), and better
integration with mozilla. Probably new column will lead to new features
related with this column.
    Piece of code will be rewritten (new scheduler).

I hope to add SOCKS in 1.25-1.30

-------------------------------------------------------
Public relation shown that other planed features had a less value.
You can see all my plans in TODO file.
