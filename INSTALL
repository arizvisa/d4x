                             Downloader for X

                            INSTALLATION MANUAL


1.0	What do you need for compilation of this program?

You need GTK version higher than 1.2.0 for compiling,
threadsafe libraries (e.g. libc6) and of course program sources.
I (author) was testing old versions of this program on RedHat 5.x,
RedHat 6.0 and Slackware 3.6. But unfortunately newest versions of
Downloader for X are stable only with libpthread-0.8 and above.

1.1	Compiling program.

Enter in directory with sources and type 'make install' (as root of course);
If you have problem with compiling make sure that:
 - you have libc6 or better
 - you have pthread-0.8 or above
 - you have GTK+ version 1.2.0 or later (www.gtk.org)
 - you have gettext (if you haven't worked it around by removing one
   line from Makefile)

If you have Mandrake, RedHat or SuSE distribution you can install
RPM file which can be found at home page of this program
(http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo).

1.2	Where can I find binary after compiling?

  You can find binary file in directory 'main' of sources tree.
It will have name 'nt'. Don't ask me why it was called 'nt'.
But this name is short (easy to type) and easy to remember. So
I think this name is quite suitable for useful program.

  'make install' will also put all files into /usr/local/bin
and /user/local/share/locale and you can run executable from
/usr/local/bin. If you don't needed localisation you can use only
executable...

1.3	How to use this program ?

Just run it and look at it and you will understand everything.
