INSTALATION MANUAL

1.0	What do you need for compiling this program?

You need GTK version higher than 1.2.0 for compiling,
safethread libraries (e.g. libc6) and of course sources of program.
I (author) was testing old versions of this program on RedHat 5.x,
RedHat 6.0 and Slackware 3.6. But unfortunately newest versions are
stable only with libpthread-0.8 and above.

1.1	Compiling program.

Enter in directory with sources and type 'make install' as root of course;
If you have problem with compiling make sure that:
-you have libc6 or better
-you have pthread-0.8 or above
-you have GTK+ version 1.2.0 or later (www.gtk.org)
-you have gettext (if you haven't it just remove one string from Makefile)

1.2	Where can i find binary after compiling?

  In directory 'main' in sources tree. It will have name 'nt'.
'make install' also  will place  all files into /usr/local/bin
and  /user/local/share/locale  and you can run executable from
/usr/local/bin. If you no needed localisation you can use only
executable...

1.3	How to use this program ?

Just run it and look at it and you will understand all.
