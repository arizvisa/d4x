1.1 What is "Downlader for X"

"Downloader for X" is a tool for downloading files from internet. It
supports both ftp and http protocols, auto reconnection after
connections' breaks, resuming downloading, recursing via http and ftp,

related with two or more different versions of one lib installed on your
system. Begining from version 1.06 "Downloader for X" does not work with
libpthreads which have version older than 0.8.
