      * UPGRADE FROM 2.0x to 2.4 *
Begining from version 2.4 Downloader for X uses .ntrc_2 directory in your
home directory to store its configuration data, queues of downloads etc.
The main reason to change default directory is switching from GTK1.x to GTK2.
GTK2 is fully unicode library so D4X have to be unicode too. If you want to
convert your old .ntrc data to new just recode them to utf8 code page.
For example in my case I've used next command (bash):

for i in ~/ntrc/*;do iconv -f koi8-r -t utf8 $i>~/ntrc_2/`basename $i';do

You can use another codepage converting tool instead of 'iconv' and most of
you have to use another codepage instead of 'koi8-r'
