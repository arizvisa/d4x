			TROUBLES

1.	I don't know how to name this program :((.
	Send your suggestions to me by e-mail (mdem@chat.ru)

2.	GTK is very bad documented. (It's not problem already
	cause I feel myself as GTK-hacker :)

3.	I need a sponsor becouse I have no money for dialup connection :(

4.	I want to write another program, maybe mailer? or better
	console file manager? or file manager for X? or something
	else which is (will be) needed under Linux.
